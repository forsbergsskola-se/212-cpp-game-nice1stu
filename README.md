Bob the Intergalactic Bog Cleaner  
  
  Bob is a sanitation technician aboard a run down spaceship travelling the galaxy.  
  He has the inglorious job of having to maintain the cleanliness of the toilets onboard the ship.  
  It is challenging at the best of times, but when the ship loses artificial gravity, the sh#t really hits the fan. 
  Literally, the effluent from the bowels of the ship comes gushing out of the toilets,  
  and it's Bob's job as sanitation technician to ensure they don't overflow.  
  Armed with his trusty plunger and his lightning fast reflexes, he must abate the flow by plunging back the  
  excrement that threatens to overflow the toilets in zero G.  
  Can Bob succeed, will he literally drown in a floating sea of sh#t?  
  
This is a Whack-A-Mole like game where the player controls Bob, our titular character, as he runs from toilet to toilet,  
plunging back the pooh that threatens to overflow.
